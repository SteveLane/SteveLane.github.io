Working as a biostatistician/researcher, my first reaction to a
[recent article](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/enough-with-feel-good-data-science/)
on Wired was 'Well, duh!'. The author, Christopher Gooley, who we are told is
the founder of a customer insights company called
[Preact](http://www.preact.io), finishes with the following:

> So if youâ€™re succeeding, know why. If you're failing, know why and do
> something about it.
