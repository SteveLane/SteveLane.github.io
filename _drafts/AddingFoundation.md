# This is the first post.

## Heading

Everyman and his dog is likely to have written about adding Foundation (link)
styling to their jekyll blog, but I'll trace my steps anyway, especially as a
record of what I've done.

I'll need to find out what the code settings for jekyll are, or I could pass
through knitr/rmarkdown?

Make sure all the required apps/dependencies are there: bower, grunt(-cli),
foundation, of course you've already installed jekyll!
