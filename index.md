# Welcome to my research page

<div class="row" data-equalizer>
	<div class="large-6 small-12 columns" data-equalizer-watch>
		<p>I am a research fellow with the <a
href="http://cebra.unimelb.edu.au/">ARC Centre of Excellence for Biosecurity Risk Analysis</a> at The University of Melbourne,
			Parkville. I am interested in effective data communication, and in the
			preparation, collation and management of complex datasets.</p>
			<p>In the menu on the top right of the page, you'll find links to my
			research notebooks. I try and write all of my research up as GitHub
			projects, unless there are privacy issues.</p>
			<p>Also in the menu, you'll find a link to my blog. Here I try and
			discuss recent publications/articles that have grabbed my
			attention.</p>
			<p>To the right (below on mobile), you'll see my GitHub activity feed. New entries
			into my research notebook as well as my blog will show up here, as
			well as commits to the various projects to which I contribute.</p>
