# Credits

This site wouldn't exist without a lot of cool work by various coders and other
researchers.

- The whole site is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and hosted on
  [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- The site is [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/), with cues from <a
  href="https://github.com/daigofuji/jekyll-foundation-5-starter/"><i class="fa
  fa-github"></i>@daigofuji</a>
- Splitting components into separate GitHub projects was inspired by <a
href="https://github.com/cboettig/notebook/"><i class="fa
  fa-github"></i>@cboettig</a>
- The GitHub widget on my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">home page</a> comes from
<a href="https://github.com/caseyscarborough/github-activity"><i class="fa
fa-github"></i>@caseyscarborough</a>

There's probably a heap of others too, so if you notice something amiss, send me
a shout!
